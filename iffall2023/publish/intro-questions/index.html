        <h1> Introductory Questions </h1>
            <ol>
               <p><li> <strong> your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</strong> </li></p> 
               <p> <em> I'm Drew Mahlmeister. I'm a third year communication design major (junior). </em> </p>

               <p> <li> <strong>  Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class. </strong></li></p>
               <p> <em> Though i am ultimately taking this class becuase it is a requirement for my major, i am really interested in the web design aspect of comdes, and know that the graphic design side of design is becoming increasingly important to understand. </em> </p>

               <p> <li> <strong>  Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</strong></li></p>
               <p> <em> no, i've never done this sort of thing before, but I am exited to learn!</em></p>

               <p> <li> <strong> Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</strong></li></p>
               <p> <em> I hope to learn the basics of website design, so that I can then learn how to design the more aesthetic aspects</em></p>

               <p> <li> <strong> Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</strong></li></p>
               <p> <em> I think that designing on paper is a very 1:1 relationship in that what you put down shows up. In website design, there is a lot of behind the scenes work where what you code creates an outcome, but not in the direct and straightforward way that it is in analog mediums.</em></p>

               <p> <li> <strong> Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</strong></li></p>
               <p> <em> I think that <a 
                href="https://www.marinelayer.com"> marine layer</a> has a really nice website design. it is simple, but provides all information necessary. The website is easy to navigate which is a great thing to place such emphasis on. the configuration of the images and labes are really aesthetically pleasing. </em></p>

                <p> <li> <strong> Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</strong></li></p>
                <p> <em> I think that <a 
                    href="https://www.freepeople.com">free people</a> does a really nice job of making all info very accessible. all the information is organized very clearly and is easy to find. </em></p>

                <p> <li> <strong> Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice. </strong></li></p>
                <p> <em> i believe <a
                    href="https://www.pinterest.com"> pinterest </a> has a really nice website. immediately upon entering the website, you are greeted with images. you dont need to navigate anywhere within the website to get started, you are immediately immersed in the content, which is nice. </em></p>
