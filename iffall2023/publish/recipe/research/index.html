    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <li> 3 (or more) bored girls </li>
    <br>
    <li> 0 plans</li>
    <br>
    <li>110% commitment to the bit</li>
    <br>
    <li> $10 (preferably in coins) </li>
    <br>
    <li> the brainpower required to draft 1 vaguely worded request implying that you want your neighbors to vacate their residence</li>
    <br>
    <li> 1 set of mystery neighbors</li>
    <br>
    <li> absolutely <strong><em>NO</em></strong> awareness</li>

    <br><br><br>

    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    <li> concieve a plan: this part is very simple, all it takes is a few seconds to think up one (1) way to mess with the neighbors down the hall.</li>
    <br>
    <li> gather support: float your ideas to the group and see which one gains the most traction.</li>
    <br> 
    <li> collect materials: draft your note and enclose the $10. </li>
    <br>
    <li> start to convince yourself this is a good idea: positive affirmations such as "nothing bad could possibly come of this" and "this is normal behavior" are good places to start.</li>
    <br> 
    <li> make the move: go slip that note under your mystery neightbors' door!</li>
    <br>
    <li> wait: this is the hardest part. the ball is in your neighbors court now, so sit back, relax, and await the impending mayhem.</li>
    <br>
    <li> play it by ear (PIBE): when you get your response, PIBE! just remember to stay 110% committed to the bit.</li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    if you follow these directions exactly, you will have a foolproof map to an exciting night, and enough embarassment for a lifetime &lt;3

    <h2> Site References </h2>
    <br> 
    <a href="https://www.delish.com">Delish </a>has a really easily navigable website. They also categorize it with other similar recipes which is really nice for user experience. 
    <br> 
    <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com"> Bon Apetit</a> has a really nice website that includes both recipes and articles, which provides a broader range of help for users. 
    <br> 
    <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com">NYT Cooking </a> has a really nice feature of "recipe of the day", which could help users who don't know what they're looking for.

    <br><br><br>
    
    <h2> Style References </h2>
    <br>
    <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com">Sally's Baking Addiction</a> has been a helpful site when crafting mine. I really appreciate the clarity both on the main website and within each recipe page. It's all very uniform and easy to navigate.
    <br> 
    <a href="https://www.browneyedbaker.com">Brown Eyed Baker</a> is similar to Sally's in that it is well organized with enticing pictures of the final products. 
    <br> 
    <a href="https://www.bakerella.com"> Bakerella</a> has really cute content, so my draw to this website is less about the design and more about the products. But it's easy to naviate which is nice!
