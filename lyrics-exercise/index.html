<p class="verse"> [VERSE 1] </p>
<p  class="body1">
Dirt on your heels <br>
You've made a mess<br>
Down by the carpark<br>
High off your head<br>
Honey, don't worry<br>
Nobody's angry at any of this<br>
Darling be patient, stare into the vacancy<br>
Take a deep breath<br>
It's like when you're tired<br>
You're someone else<br>
Don't speak for some time to find those words <br>
Inside yourself<br>
Honey, don't worry<br>
I'll do your laundry<br>
Covered in dirt<br>
Darling, be patient<br>
It's easy to break beneath the weight of the Earth<br>
And I say<br><br></p>

<p class="verse"> [CHORUS] </p> <br>

<p class="body1">
Always, I'll wait<br>
For sharp glass when you break<br>
I'll be the light that you can't make<br>
I'll be your eyes, you be my face<br>
'Cause darling, I get scared for you<br>
And I'm not busy anyway<br><br></p>

<p class="verse"> [VERSE 2] </p><br>

<p class="body1">
Today you looked older than me<br>
Hair in your face<br>
It fills the space between your teeth<br>
And all of your falling<br>
Does it get exhausting? <br>
Have you gotten sleep?<br>
You said you were sorry <br>
That you hadn't called me in over a week<br>
And I say<br><br></p>

<p class="verse"> [CHORUS] </p> <br>

<p class="body1">
Always, I'll wait<br>
For sharp glass when you break<br>
I'll be the light that you can't make<br>
I'll be your eyes, you be my face<br>
'Cause darling, I get scared for you<br>
And I'm not busy anyway<br><br></p>

<p class="verse"> [BRIDGE] </p><br>

<p class="body1">
I hope, I ain't the last of what the world left you<br>
A coat, something you only wear in cold weather<br>
I hope, I ain't the last of what the world left you<br>
A coat, something you only wear in cold weather<br>
I hope, I ain't the last of what the world left you<br>
A coat, something you only wear in cold weather<br>
And I hope, I ain't the last of what the world left you<br>
A coat, something you only wear in cold weather<br>
(You know that)<br>
And I say<br><br></p>

<p class="verse"> [CHORUS] </p><br>

<p class="body1">
Always, I'll wait<br>
For sharp glass when you break<br>
I'll be the light that you can't make<br>
I'll be your eyes, you be my face<br>
'Cause darling, I get scared for you<br>
And I'm not busy anyway<br><br></p>
    </p>
