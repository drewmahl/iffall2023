        <h2> Versions of Tetris</h2>
            <p>Tetris has been released on a multitude of platforms since the creation of the original version on the Electronika 60. The game is available on most game consoles and is playable on personal computers, smartphones and iPods. Guinness World Records recognized Tetris as the most ported video game in history, having appeared on over 65 different platforms as of October 2010</p>

            <p>Since the 2000s, internet versions of the game have been developed. However, commercial versions not approved by the Tetris Company tend to be purged due to company policy.[37][38] The most famous online version, Tetris Friends by Tetris Online, Inc., had attracted over a million registered users.[44] Tetris Online had also developed versions for console-based digital download services.[45][46] Because of its popularity and simplicity of development, Tetris is often used as a hello world project for programmers coding for a new system or programming language. This has resulted in the availability of a large number of ports for different platforms. For instance, Î¼Torrent and GNU Emacs contain similar shape-stacking games as easter eggs.</p>
            
            <p>Within official franchise installments, each version has made improvements to accommodate advancing technology and the goal to provide a more complete game. Developers are given freedom to add new modes of play and revisit the concept from different angles. Some concepts developed on official versions have been integrated into the Tetris guidelines in order to standardize future versions and allow players to migrate between different versions with little effort.[7] The IBM PC version was the most evolved from the original version, featuring a graphical interface, colored tetrominoes, running statistics for the number of tetrominoes placed, and a guide for the controls. </p>
